# iTunesToSonos
Simple Python script to export chosen playlists and their music from iTunes - intended for sharing with Sonos, but uses industry standard formats

Still very work-in-progress - only shared to help diagnose issues with Unicode characters via StackOverflow.  Hope to have resolved and share fully working code very soon...
